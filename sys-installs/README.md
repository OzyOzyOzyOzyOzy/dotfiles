### installation.sh

Instructions:

Run the script with `sudo bash installation.sh`

The script will then prompt for a package name to install with apt. If the package is not found, the script will terminate and notify the user. If the package is found, the script will use apt to install the package silently. When installation is finished, the script will notify user whether the install was succesful.
