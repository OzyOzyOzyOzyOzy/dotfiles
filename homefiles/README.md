## Bash RC explanation

The included bashrc file in this repo adds 2 alias' and one change to the behaviour of bash. The 2 alias' are for `cd ../` and `cd ../../`

## Script Notes

DO NOT RUN THE SCRIPT AS SUDO. Bad things may happen. The script is very coarse and does not have catch statements for running as sudo. Proper usage is as follows: cd into the repo, run the script with either `bash bashrcscript.sh` or `./bashrcscript.sh`.
